## Introduction
Mobile phone traces, commonly known as Call Detail Records (CDR), present crucial data resources, particularly in data-scarce environments. This study focuses on leveraging CDR data to monitor COVID-19 outbreak responses, evaluate the effectiveness of control policies, and provide timely feedback to refine policy implementations. By collaborating closely with the Sierra Leone government's COVID-19 response team, the research aims to utilize human mobility patterns derived from CDR data to understand the impact of government policies during the early stages of the pandemic.

## Objectives
### Policy Impact Assessment:
Evaluate the impact of COVID-19 control policies implemented by the Sierra Leone government.
### Socioeconomic Analysis:
Assess the responsiveness of different socioeconomic groups to pandemic restrictions.
### Mobility Metrics Generation:
Generate key mobility metrics from CDR data, including radius of gyration, regularity of movement, and user mobility motif types.
### Cross-Referencing with Socioeconomic Data:
Analyze and cross-reference mobility metrics with socioeconomic data to identify patterns and correlations.

## Results and Insights
Our findings reveal that, overall, the majority of Sierra Leone residents demonstrated a high level of responsiveness to COVID-19 restrictions. Notably, lower-income users exhibited a tendency to travel greater distances both before and after lockdown, potentially indicating increased vulnerability to the virus.
